Russian roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body (of the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel, the weapon will fire, killing or severely injuring the player. We tried to create and simulate same game using Python and concepts of Game Theory.

We tried to develop a GUI for the game interface using Pygame and Tkinter libraries of python
